Potentially UNwanted WEbsite Filter

Todo:

* Figure out ad real estate - how much % of the page is ads? Can we diff with adblocker? Detect things that look like ads? Like if they load after the page is done loading. Score page based on that.
* Red flag if a site causes takeover popups on mobile (“congrats you’re the 1000th iPhone user”) or if a pop up happens upon clicking in white space or following an internal link on the page.
